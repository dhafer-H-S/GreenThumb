# Disease Detection System for Tunisian Crops

In Tunisia, agriculture plays a vital role in the economy, and ensuring the health of crops is essential for sustainable farming. One innovative tool that aids farmers in this endeavor is the Disease Detection System. This system leverages advanced algorithms to analyze images of plant leaves, identifying crop types and detecting diseases. In this blog, we will explore how this system works and its benefits for Tunisian farmers.

## How the Disease Detection System Works

The Disease Detection System is designed to be user-friendly and efficient. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how it operates:

1. **Upload an Image**  
    Farmers can upload an image of the leaf of their plant to the system.

2. **Crop Identification**  
    The algorithm analyzes the image to determine the crop type. This is crucial as different crops are susceptible to different diseases.

3. **Disease Detection**  
    The system then checks if the plant is healthy or diseased. If a disease is detected, it identifies the cause of the disease.

4. **Recommendations**  
    The system provides suggestions on how to prevent or cure the disease, offering tailored advice based on the specific crop and disease.
