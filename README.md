# Smart Farming, Bright Future
#### An Environmental Intelligence Startup

## End Of Machine Learning Curriculum Project

@ 2025 Smart Farming, Bright Future

## MOTIVATION 
- Farming is one of the major sectors that influences a country‚Äôs economic growth. 

- In countries like India, the majority of the population is dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. Many new technologies, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning, are being implemented into agriculture so that it is easier for farmers to grow and maximize their yield. 

- In this project, I present a website in which the following applications are implemented: Crop recommendation, Fertilizer recommendation, and Plant disease prediction, respectively. 

  - In the crop recommendation application, the user can provide the soil data from their side and the application will predict which crop the user should grow. 
  
  - For the fertilizer recommendation application, the user can input the soil data and the type of crop they are growing, and the application will predict what the soil lacks or has excess of and will recommend improvements. 
  
  - For the plant disease prediction application, the user can input an image of a diseased plant leaf, and the application will predict what disease it is and will also give a little background about the disease and suggestions to cure it.

## How to run locally üõ†Ô∏è
- Before the following steps make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/download), [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed on your system
  ```
  ‚ùØ git clone https://github.com/dhafer-H-S/GreenThumb
  ```

- Once the project is cloned, open anaconda prompt in the directory where the project was cloned and paste the following block
  ```
  conda create -n GreenThumb python=3.6.12
  python --version
  output should be => Python 3.6.12 :: Anaconda, Inc.
  conda activate GreenThumb
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- And finally run the project with
  ```
  python app.py
  ```
- Open the localhost URL provided after running `python app/app.py` and now you can use the project locally in your web browser.


## How to use üíª
- Smart Plant Care Recommendations :
Our system also provides special treatment recommendations tailored to the crop you choose and your specific location (city and state). By analyzing key parameters such as soil nutrients (N-P-K ratios), pH levels, soil moisture, temperature, and light conditions, the system offers precise advice to help you achieve the best results. For example, if you choose to grow almonds in a particular city, the system will recommend the optimal nutrient requirements (N: 45, P: 20, K: 35), ideal pH level (6.5), soil moisture (25%), temperature range (15-30¬∞C), light conditions (full sunlight, prefers long hot summers and well-drained soil), and preferred watering schedule (20 liters / 50 mm per week). This personalized guidance ensures that your crops receive the best possible care based on your local conditions.

- Crop Recommendation System: 
Input the nutrient values of your soil, along with your state and city. Ensure that the N-P-K (Nitrogen-Phosphorous-Potassium) values are entered as their respective ratios. For more details, refer to [this article](https://medium.com/@dhaferhamzasfaxi1/crop-recommendation-system-leveraging-data-for-smarter-farming-b804374d2856). Note: When entering the city name, use commonly known cities. Remote locations may not be supported by the [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) used to fetch humidity and temperature data.

- Fertilizer suggestion system :
 Enter the nutrient contents of your soil and the crop you want to grow. The algorithm will tell which nutrient the soil has excess of or lacks. Accordingly, it will give suggestions for buying fertilizers. For more details, refer to [this article](https://medium.com/@dhaferhamzasfaxi1/fertilizer-suggestion-system-enhancing-soil-health-for-better-crop-yields-8b81a2803e1a).

- Disease Detection System:
Upload an image of the leaf of your plant. The algorithm will tell the crop type and whether it is diseased or healthy. If it is diseased, it will tell you the cause of the disease and suggest how to prevent/cure the disease accordingly. For more details, refer to [this article](https://medium.com/@dhaferhamzasfaxi1/disease-detection-system-for-tunisian-crops-e74aaa553ce0).
Note that, for now it only supports the following crops:
